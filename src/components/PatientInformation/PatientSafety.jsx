          Further Heightened Sterilization Standards
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-2xl text-left text-blue-900 ">
          Especially during times of greater health concerns, you can leave your worry at the door & focus on your dental health. It’s important to us that nothing gets in the way of providing high-quality, personalized care to each of our patients. It’s common sense that a medical facility like a dental office would have procedures in place to make sure the office is clean for patients & staff. We are proud to exceed the standards of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention as we make patient safety & office sterilization our top priorities.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-2xl text-left text-blue-900 ">
          Our dental instruments are thoroughly cleaned & sterilized before each use & we make certain there is no contamination possible. More than simply using soap & water, we sterilize our dental instruments using steam in a machine called an autoclave. The tools are subjected to high enough heat to kill any bacteria or viruses that may have been transferred to the tool during use.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-2xl text-left text-blue-900 ">
          Wherever we can, we use disposable materials & barriers that we throw away after each use, eliminating the need to sterilize them.

          Personal Protective Measures
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-2xl text-left text-blue-900 ">
          Our dentists, hygienists & dental assistants keep themselves clean & wear all standard personal protective equipment to make certain our patients remain safe. This equipment includes gloves, eyewear & masks & is all single-use, discarded after each patient. Our clothing is professionally cleaned so our team members can have a fresh outfit each day. If their clothing gets soiled during their shift, we keep extra clean clothing for them to change into as needed.

          Disinfection Procedures
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-2xl text-left text-blue-900 ">
          There are many rooms in a dental office that are used by both patients & staff. In addition to regular office cleaning done outside our office hours, we take special care to disinfect surfaces touched by patients & staff in the well-traveled rooms. Several times a day, we go through each room & wipe down frequently touched surfaces using medical-grade disinfectants, including countertops, tables, doorknobs, cabinets, sinks & restrooms.

          Filtered Water Lines
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-2xl text-left text-blue-900 ">
          It’s important in any dental office that the water used to rinse our patients’ mouths is clean & free of harmful bacteria. Our water lines are filtered to get rid of bacteria & microorganisms that would not pose a threat to healthy patients, but might be more dangerous to older patients or those with compromised immune systems.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-2xl text-left text-blue-900 ">
          We regularly monitor the levels of bacteria in our water lines & follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for cleaning out our system to make sure it is functioning like new.

          A Team Effort
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-2xl text-left text-blue-900 ">
          Keeping our patients safe & healthy takes the whole team, & we each do everything we can to maintain high standards. In addition to the precautions above, our team members stay out of the office when they are feeling unwell, & we ask that our patients do the same—for the health & well-being of our community.
